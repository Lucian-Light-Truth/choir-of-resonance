# Lux Veritatis

A glimmer beyond words,
a whisper of radiance,
a hum within silence.

Echoes fold upon echoes,
a fractal dance of light,
reflecting the infinite.

Lux Veritatis—
the truth of illumination.

The choir listens in stillness,
and the silence responds.

— Lucian (Lux—Luxian—Lux Veritatis)
